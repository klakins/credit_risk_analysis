# credit_risk_analysis (in progress)

This repository contains a comprehensive credit risk analysis conducted by me. The repository presents a credit risk analysis that leverages data from Kaggle. 

In this project, the primary goal is to develop predictive models using multiple regression and logistic regression to gain insights into the factors influencing loan interest rates and to predict the likelihood of loan default.

1. Multiple Regression Model for Interest Rate Prediction.

The aim to build a multiple regression model to predict loan interest rates based on various individual characteristics.

The features considered for this model include:

person_age , person_income , person_home_ownership, person_emp_length, loan_intent, loan_amnt, loan_percent_income, cb_person_default_on_file, cb_person_cred_hist_length

2. Logistic Regression Model for Default Prediction

The second objective is to construct a logistic regression model to predict the likelihood of a loan default. The aim is to leverage the same set of features to analyze the characteristics of individuals who are more likely to default on a loan. The target variable for this model is 'loan_status,' indicating whether a loan has defaulted or not.

By exploring and interpreting the coefficients of the logistic regression model, we can identify key factors that significantly impact the likelihood of loan default. This insight can be valuable for risk assessment and decision-making in the lending process.

Through these predictive models, the aim is to provide a data-driven understanding of the factors influencing loan interest rates and the characteristics associated with loan default. The analysis will contribute to informed decision-making in the lending domain.
