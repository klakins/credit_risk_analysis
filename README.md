# Credit Risk Analysis - Data Pre-processing and EDA

## Overview
This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that documents the process of data preprocessing, cleaning, and exploratory data analysis (EDA) conducted on a credit risk dataset found via Kaggle. The goal of this project was to prepare the data  for further analysis, ensuring the integrity and reliability of subsequent predictive modeling.

## Features
- **Data Cleaning:** Implemented strategies for dealing with missing values, outliers, and anomalies to improve data quality.
- **Data Transformation:** Performed necessary transformations on the data to make it suitable for analysis, including normalization and encoding categorical variables.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Utilized visual and statistical methods to explore the data and gain deeper insights into the distribution of variables and their relationships.

## Tools Used
- Pandas: For data manipulation and cleaning.
- Seaborn and Matplotlib: For visualizing the data and uncovering trends and patterns.
- NumPy: For numerical computations.

## Future Work
The next phase of this project will focus on expanding the predictive capabilities of the analysis. I plan to implement logistic regression to predict customer behavior, specifically identifying the likelihood of loan default based on the insights gained from the initial data preprocessing and EDA. This predictive model aims to provide a proactive approach for financial institutions to mitigate risk by accurately flagging high-risk profiles before loan approval.
